# The Celestial Plane

Home of the gods and their most loved creations, the Celestial Plane was the birthplace of the [Material Plane](Material_plane.md)

Originally it and the [Infernal Plane](Infernal_Plane.md) were one (known as the Primordial Plane), but at some point it was shattered, the largest shards eventually resolving into the Celestial and Infernal Planes, where they are both drawn towards and repelled from each other for all eternity.

The smaller shards span off, forming their own minor planes (eg: [The Fey](The_Fey.md)), and possibly even connected to [The Beyond](The_Beyond.md), which has allowed the denizens of that unfathomable place to brush against the other planes, and occasionally bleed through.

The Creatures that inhabit the Celestial Plane are most commonly referred to as [Celestials](/Creatures/Celestials.md).
