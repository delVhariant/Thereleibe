# The Infernal Plane
The Infernal Plane is the second major shard that survived after the shattering of the Primordial Plane (Refer to the [Material Plane](Material_Plane.md) for more information)

Creatures that inhabit the Infernal Plane are referred to as [Devils](../Creatures/Devils.md) in the common tongue, and by modern standards can be considered Evil.
