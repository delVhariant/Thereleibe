# The Beyond

Little is known of The Beyond, although as many theories exist as there are scholars.

All of the other Planes have had some contact with this place and its denizens, though the effects are often subtle.

Some Warlocks are known to have opened connections with the creatures of the beyond, and there are some similarities in their experiences, which generally speak of the sensation of an insect trying to understand the ocean. Almost all report a sense of ancient timelessness that is familiar to natives of the [Elemental Planes](Elemental_Planes.md), which has led to  common names such as 'Elder Gods', 'Ancients' and 'Great Old Ones'

Some speak of unending hatred, others of no emotions or discernible intelligence at all, merely a presence or force that doesn't even acknowledge their presence, let alone communicate with them.

There also appears to be some degree of conflict within The Beyond, as supplicants of different entities have been able to sense each other, and tell stories of unreasonable hatred and fear toward each other. In one documented case a Warlock was able to contact two such entities simultaneously, at which point Her physical form collapsed into itself in a horrific implosion of otherworldly magic.

Nevertheless, some entities have been given names and some degree of personality attributed to them.
It is also undeniable that those who manage to maintain a connection with these creatures can receive great powers, although there is almost always a horrifying cost to be paid by themselves, others, or even the very land around them.
