# The Fey
A minor plane of existence, it is closely connected to the [Material Plane](Material_Plane.md), and its inhabitants are ofen able to pass freely between the two.

The immortal creatures of The Fey are mercurial in nature, and have been known to form plans for centuries only to abandon them in a moment.

Many creatures of The Fey are thought to be closely related to the [Devils](Devils.md) of the [Infernal Plane](Infernal_Plane.md) as they enjoy making deals and pacts, although their reasons for doing so are even less discernable than that of the Devils.
