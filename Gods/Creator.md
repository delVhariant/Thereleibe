# The Creator

The Creator is the force that birthed the [Material](/Planes/Material_Plane.md) and [Elemental](/Planes/Elemental_Planes.md) Planes at the beginning of time.

More of a force than a personality, not many worship the Creator directly, but instead of the other Gods that is more easily comprehended by mortals.

Followers of the Creator are often craftsmen or philosophers, although there are some that believe purely in preservation.
