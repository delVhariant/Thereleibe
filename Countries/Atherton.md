# Atherton

Atherton is a small country entirely within the borders of [Galkrist](Galkist.md)

It is almost exlcusively human, and its citizens tend to have dark skin and hair.

It was founded ~500 years ago by Alkier Atherton (a Galkristian Noble) after a brief civil war.
A small kingdom, it has no major cities and consists of Atherton Keep, the nearby town of Atherton, and a number of satellite villages and farms.
