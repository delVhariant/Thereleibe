# Galkrist

Galkrist is a medium sized Kingdom, located in the North of Thereleibe.
Formerly a Human Empire, the nation is now much more diverse and considerably smaller after a period of prolonged wars lasting from about 700-500 years ago.

The Hereditary Monarch and Head of State is a Human ([Dreythus Galkrist](#dreythus)).
The Monarch has little to do with actual governance of the country, which is instead performed by councils and committees at the town/city level.

Galkrist is known for having a long memory, and once a year observes the 'Week of Remembrance', where old debts can be called upon, legends of days past are told, and the contents of the 'Book of Blood Oaths'[1](#f1) is proclaimed across the kingdom.

It Neighbors [Reveill](Reveill.md) to the West, and borders the Ferregorn Ocean to the North and East.
[Kranen](Kranen.md) lies to the South, and [Atherton](Atherton.md) exists entirely within the borders of Galkrist

## References
#### <a name=f1></a>The Book of Blood Oaths
This is one of the oldest surviving artefacts in Galkrist, and contains a list of every person, family or country that has slighted the Royal family or Kingdom, and the cost to atone for their trangressions.  
Little is done to pursue these oaths in recent years, but the tradition of proclamation remains.
